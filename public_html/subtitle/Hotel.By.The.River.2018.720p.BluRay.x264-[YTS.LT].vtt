<i>Hotel by the River</i>

9
00:01:08.944 --> 00:01:12.030
<i>It's cold today, too.</i>

10
00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.368
<i>I wish this cold would go away.</i>

11
00:01:18.579 --> 00:01:20.622
<i>Did she hurt her hand?</i>

12
00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:52.321
- Are you here?
<i>- Yes, where are you?</i>

13
00:01:52.487 --> 00:01:55.949
I'll go down.
Wait in the 1st floor cafe.

14
00:01:56.241 --> 00:01:59.244
<i>No, we're almost there.
What's your room number?</i>

15
00:01:59.494 --> 00:02:01.371
I'll be right down.

16
00:02:01.705 --> 00:02:04.333
<i>I don't mind coming up.
What number?</i>

17
00:02:05.167 --> 00:02:07.252
You're coming up?

18
00:02:09.463 --> 00:02:12.299
No, it's better if I go down.

19
00:02:12.758 --> 00:02:15.844
- I'll go downstairs.
<i>- Why pay for expensive coffee?</i>

20
00:02:15.886 --> 00:02:19.264
<i>I brought coffee. We'll go up.
What number?</i>

21
00:02:22.225 --> 00:02:23.602
Will you?

22
00:02:24.144 --> 00:02:24.853
<i>Yeah.</i>

23
00:02:25.395 --> 00:02:29.691
No, it's better if I go down.
I'll go down.

24
00:02:30.942 --> 00:02:32.486
Wait for me there.

25
00:02:32.694 --> 00:02:34.571
<i>- Are you sure?</i>
- Yeah.

26
00:02:34.738 --> 00:02:36.406
But I bought coffee...

27
00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.035
<i>All right, then.</i>

28
00:02:40.786 --> 00:02:42.871
Yeah, let's do that.

29
00:02:43.747 --> 00:02:44.414
Yeah.

30
00:02:44.665 --> 00:02:47.501
<i>- Then we'll wait in the cafe.</i>
- Okay.

31
00:03:41.972 --> 00:03:44.307
<i>I've done something foolish again.</i>

32
00:03:45.183 --> 00:03:48.270
<i>Why did I call them here?</i>

33
00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:51.314
<i>I better not mess up.</i>

34
00:03:52.441 --> 00:03:54.901
<i>Will my daughter-in-law come?</i>

35
00:03:55.944 --> 00:03:57.821
<i>She's such a nice girl.</i>

36
00:04:49.164 --> 00:04:51.583
- Hello.
- How are you?

37
00:04:52.793 --> 00:04:54.044
Going somewhere?

38
00:04:54.878 --> 00:04:57.506
- Does it look that way?
- Yes.

39
00:04:57.964 --> 00:04:59.591
You're all dressed.

40
00:05:00.383 --> 00:05:02.469
I'm meeting someone.

41
00:05:12.395 --> 00:05:16.358
Could I ask you a favor?

42
00:05:16.858 --> 00:05:18.568
- A favor?
- Yes.

43
00:05:19.444 --> 00:05:21.738
I went to a bookstore yesterday,

44
00:05:22.572 --> 00:05:25.158
and bought your book.

45
00:05:26.618 --> 00:05:28.495
- Really?
- Yes.

46
00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:33.750
- Would you autograph it?
- Sure, of course.

47
00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.628
- Then I'll bring it later.
- Okay.

48
00:05:37.379 --> 00:05:38.797
Thank you.

49
00:05:39.381 --> 00:05:41.842
I hope I'm not bothering you.

50
00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:45.679
No, not at all.
I should thank you.

51
00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:49.641
My boss told me
not to bother you.

52
00:05:49.808 --> 00:05:51.685
Don't worry.

53
00:05:52.686 --> 00:05:53.937
Thank you.

54
00:05:54.855 --> 00:05:57.023
- Then I'll bring it later.
- Okay.

55
00:05:57.816 --> 00:05:59.150
Just a minute.

56
00:06:02.487 --> 00:06:04.364
What's your name?

57
00:06:04.906 --> 00:06:05.699
Me?

58
00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:09.494
I'm Shin Yoojung.

59
00:06:09.828 --> 00:06:11.705
Shin Yoojung.

60
00:06:13.248 --> 00:06:15.709
That's a nice name.

61
00:06:16.585 --> 00:06:18.628
A bit old-fashioned, right?

62
00:06:19.296 --> 00:06:20.922
Is it?

63
00:06:23.049 --> 00:06:24.926
I don't think so.

64
00:06:26.136 --> 00:06:27.721
Thank you.

65
00:06:28.305 --> 00:06:30.432
- Enjoy your coffee.
- Thanks.

66
00:06:46.865 --> 00:06:49.117
<i>This needs water.</i>

67
00:06:51.912 --> 00:06:54.414
<i>They should water it.</i>

68
00:07:34.204 --> 00:07:36.373
<i>The magpies are building a nest.</i>

69
00:07:37.248 --> 00:07:39.668
<i>How impressive, out in that cold.</i>

70
00:08:49.029 --> 00:08:50.113
Hello?

71
00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:52.866
<i>It's me.
Where are you?</i>

72
00:08:53.324 --> 00:08:55.201
In the room.
Where are you?

73
00:08:55.869 --> 00:08:59.289
<i>I'm almost there.
What room number?</i>

74
00:09:00.248 --> 00:09:02.542
It's room 201.

75
00:09:03.334 --> 00:09:05.795
<i>All right,
I'll be there soon.</i>

76
00:09:06.671 --> 00:09:09.799
<i>Do you need anything?
Something to drink?</i>

77
00:09:10.884 --> 00:09:15.638
If there's any coffee,
can you bring me a cup?

78
00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:18.058
The coffee here is terrible.

79
00:09:18.433 --> 00:09:20.226
<i>Okay, I will.</i>

80
00:09:20.935 --> 00:09:22.812
<i>Anything else?</i>

81
00:09:23.521 --> 00:09:25.440
<i>Some cake?</i>

82
00:09:26.149 --> 00:09:29.694
Sure, buy something sweet.

83
00:09:30.153 --> 00:09:34.240
<i>- Okay, see you soon.</i>
- Bye.

84
00:12:06.976 --> 00:12:09.187
Shouldn't we call him?

85
00:12:09.354 --> 00:12:10.521
He'll be down.

86
00:12:11.731 --> 00:12:14.108
He said he'll come down.

87
00:12:20.490 --> 00:12:23.534
Doesn't this look like
Tumen River?

88
00:12:24.953 --> 00:12:28.581
- Tumen River?
- The landscape is similar.

89
00:12:29.123 --> 00:12:33.836
I've never seen Tumen River,
but isn't this wider?

90
00:12:34.462 --> 00:12:37.465
Of course.
That's not what I mean.

91
00:12:38.549 --> 00:12:39.467
Look.

92
00:12:39.509 --> 00:12:41.511
The scenery on that side.

93
00:12:41.552 --> 00:12:45.431
See those
unfinished buildings?

94
00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:53.106
Have you been to Tumen River?

95
00:12:53.273 --> 00:12:55.525
Of course not.

96
00:12:56.109 --> 00:12:58.486
But I've seen documentaries.

97
00:12:58.778 --> 00:13:00.321
- Have you?
- Yeah.

98
00:13:03.366 --> 00:13:04.242
What?

99
00:13:04.575 --> 00:13:09.122
When we were young,
you sang that Tumen River song.

100
00:13:09.706 --> 00:13:12.875
Mom kept asking you to.

101
00:13:15.003 --> 00:13:15.837
Did I?

102
00:13:15.878 --> 00:13:19.966
Whenever guests came,
she made you sing it.

103
00:13:21.634 --> 00:13:23.052
If you say so.

104
00:13:24.762 --> 00:13:25.888
All right.

105
00:13:30.601 --> 00:13:31.769
You're doing okay?

106
00:13:32.270 --> 00:13:33.813
You made some money?

107
00:13:34.897 --> 00:13:37.650
Yeah, I did.

108
00:13:41.237 --> 00:13:44.282
It's the production company
who profited, not me.

109
00:13:44.324 --> 00:13:47.201
I just get what they pay me.

110
00:13:47.618 --> 00:13:49.203
So how much did you make?

111
00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:51.706
What?

112
00:13:52.623 --> 00:13:54.500
Not very much.

113
00:13:56.252 --> 00:14:02.050
But you know, people are
waiting for my next movie.

114
00:14:03.134 --> 00:14:04.677
Something's changed.

115
00:14:04.719 --> 00:14:08.014
I can feel the difference.

116
00:14:09.223 --> 00:14:11.059
Stop bragging, Buffoon.

117
00:14:11.642 --> 00:14:13.353
Listen to you.

118
00:14:13.436 --> 00:14:14.187
Hey.

119
00:14:15.229 --> 00:14:17.523
How can you call me that?

120
00:14:17.774 --> 00:14:20.735
Still talking like that at your age.

121
00:14:20.943 --> 00:14:23.696
That's your name, Buffoon.

122
00:14:25.406 --> 00:14:27.742
How can you say that word?

123
00:14:28.034 --> 00:14:31.621
Ask Dad why he gave
you a name that sounds similar.

124
00:14:31.746 --> 00:14:33.206
What a Buffoon.

125
00:14:35.875 --> 00:14:37.794
Why doesn't he come?

126
00:14:38.127 --> 00:14:40.088
You don't think
something's wrong?

127
00:14:40.254 --> 00:14:43.257
I just talked to him.
He'll be down.

128
00:14:50.139 --> 00:14:55.186
You and me are so different.

129
00:14:55.937 --> 00:14:56.896
Right?

130
00:14:58.272 --> 00:14:59.899
You think so?

131
00:15:00.274 --> 00:15:03.945
Everyone in our family
looks different.

132
00:15:05.279 --> 00:15:06.614
I guess so.

133
00:15:07.281 --> 00:15:09.951
But you're more like Mom.

134
00:15:09.992 --> 00:15:12.161
You're slender, like her.

135
00:15:13.371 --> 00:15:14.789
I guess so.

136
00:15:15.957 --> 00:15:19.127
And you're like Dad.

137
00:15:20.461 --> 00:15:21.587
Your height.

138
00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:25.007
Always bragging about
your height, Buffoon.

139
00:15:25.925 --> 00:15:29.720
- When do I brag about my height?
- Just forget it!

140
00:15:30.221 --> 00:15:33.307
- Why are you so sensitive?
- Just stop it.

141
00:15:33.975 --> 00:15:36.811
You always bring it back
to your height.

142
00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:40.189
Stop it!

143
00:15:40.273 --> 00:15:41.899
You stop it!

144
00:15:44.110 --> 00:15:47.071
- How's your hand?
- It's okay.

145
00:15:47.488 --> 00:15:50.491
There's no blistering,
so it should be okay.

146
00:15:51.159 --> 00:15:52.368
Really?

147
00:15:53.703 --> 00:15:57.874
Good, it's usually okay
if there are no blisters.

148
00:15:58.291 --> 00:16:02.003
- There won't be a scar.
- That's what I heard.

149
00:16:02.670 --> 00:16:04.464
It'll be fine.

150
00:16:04.964 --> 00:16:07.133
Show it to me.

151
00:16:07.467 --> 00:16:10.386
Then I'll know for sure.

152
00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:15.308
- I don't want to show you.
- Why not, it's okay!

153
00:16:15.892 --> 00:16:18.644
If it looks bad,
we'll visit the doctor.

154
00:16:18.686 --> 00:16:23.774
It's fine. They gave me
ointment at the pharmacy.

155
00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:26.235
They said it's 1st degree.

156
00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:29.113
- 1st degree?
- Yes, a 1st degree burn.

157
00:16:30.573 --> 00:16:34.410
Almost the same as a sunburn.

158
00:16:35.578 --> 00:16:37.413
That's a relief, then.

159
00:16:39.832 --> 00:16:41.584
I'm not worried.

160
00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:46.839
You know,
you're amazing.

161
00:16:47.298 --> 00:16:49.217
How do you do it?

162
00:16:50.801 --> 00:16:52.136
Thank you.

163
00:17:08.110 --> 00:17:11.364
- You're okay, right?
- Of course.

164
00:17:17.870 --> 00:17:19.539
He's so heartless.

165
00:17:20.331 --> 00:17:21.916
Forget him.

166
00:17:22.333 --> 00:17:23.417
You're right.

167
00:17:24.669 --> 00:17:27.547
It's so cold-hearted
what he did.

168
00:17:31.133 --> 00:17:33.886
It's okay.
I'm at peace.

169
00:17:34.679 --> 00:17:35.930
Really?

170
00:17:37.390 --> 00:17:40.393
- You're really okay?
- I'm fine.

171
00:17:41.852 --> 00:17:45.690
No, to be honest...

172
00:17:50.027 --> 00:17:51.904
I don't know.

173
00:17:52.196 --> 00:17:54.156
Just tell me!

174
00:17:57.702 --> 00:18:00.246
I will,
I'll tell you everything.

175
00:18:00.413 --> 00:18:03.541
But right now I'll rest.

176
00:18:05.751 --> 00:18:06.961
I understand.

177
00:18:08.045 --> 00:18:09.630
Let's do that.

178
00:18:14.385 --> 00:18:16.554
I don't want to think.

179
00:18:18.764 --> 00:18:21.309
He didn't call?
Don't call him!

180
00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:23.686
I won't call him.
You think I'm crazy?

181
00:18:23.728 --> 00:18:25.563
Don't even think of it!

182
00:18:26.147 --> 00:18:28.733
He's gone.
It's over already.

183
00:18:29.734 --> 00:18:31.485
Believe it!

184
00:18:31.944 --> 00:18:32.945
Yeah.

185
00:18:42.788 --> 00:18:44.373
Are you okay?

186
00:18:45.499 --> 00:18:49.337
- Want to lie down?
- Yeah, I'll lie down a bit.

187
00:19:01.932 --> 00:19:04.769
Thanks, I know
it's hard for you, too.

188
00:19:06.937 --> 00:19:09.023
Yes, it is hard.

189
00:19:09.940 --> 00:19:12.693
But still, life goes on.

190
00:19:23.954 --> 00:19:26.749
- Thank you.
- It's nothing.

191
00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:33.339
You've been so unlucky.

192
00:19:39.053 --> 00:19:41.180
You too.

193
00:19:56.320 --> 00:19:57.863
Is it hard for you?

194
00:19:59.865 --> 00:20:00.950
No.

195
00:20:02.535 --> 00:20:04.787
Lie down here.

196
00:20:08.666 --> 00:20:10.251
Should I?

197
00:20:25.224 --> 00:20:26.434
It's cold.

198
00:20:53.753 --> 00:20:55.921
This snow fell for us.

199
00:20:57.006 --> 00:20:58.382
Don't you think?

200
00:20:58.799 --> 00:21:00.259
I do.

201
00:21:00.843 --> 00:21:05.598
It's amazing.
How could so much fall so quickly?

202
00:21:05.806 --> 00:21:08.976
In that short time we slept,

203
00:21:09.185 --> 00:21:11.228
all this snow!

204
00:21:13.397 --> 00:21:16.150
It's a blessing for us.

205
00:21:18.152 --> 00:21:20.404
I feel so thankful.

206
00:21:25.868 --> 00:21:28.621
When snow falls,
there's a reason.

207
00:21:29.497 --> 00:21:31.373
It's always that way.

208
00:21:32.166 --> 00:21:33.626
You're right.

209
00:21:35.753 --> 00:21:39.006
- Only with snow, not rain.
- Right!

210
00:21:39.882 --> 00:21:41.801
You feel that, too?

211
00:21:43.636 --> 00:21:50.601
When I was young, and kids gathered
by the window to see the snow,

212
00:21:50.684 --> 00:21:54.188
our teacher asked us,
are you puppies?

213
00:21:54.271 --> 00:21:58.818
He said only puppies
love the snow like that.

214
00:22:00.778 --> 00:22:06.784
Strangely, every time it snows
I remember his words.

215
00:22:08.744 --> 00:22:14.625
The kids crowding up to the window
looked just like puppies.

216
00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:17.503
- It was so cute.
- Right!

217
00:22:17.837 --> 00:22:22.633
- Dogs love the snow, isn't it cute?
- It's so cute.

218
00:22:45.656 --> 00:22:47.700
<i>I guess they didn't come.</i>

219
00:22:48.826 --> 00:22:50.536
<i>What happened?</i>

220
00:22:52.162 --> 00:22:54.623
<i>Did I do something wrong?</i>

221
00:23:31.577 --> 00:23:33.871
- Hello.
- Hello.

222
00:23:34.622 --> 00:23:37.249
- Are you going in?
- Yes.

223
00:23:41.962 --> 00:23:46.592
You two looked so pretty,
I came out to greet you.

224
00:23:48.052 --> 00:23:50.137
Really? Thank you.

225
00:23:50.930 --> 00:23:55.517
It was like a sublime painting.

226
00:23:56.310 --> 00:24:01.690
I opened my eyes,
and there you were upon the snow.

227
00:24:02.149 --> 00:24:04.860
I didn't know
so much had fallen.

228
00:24:07.947 --> 00:24:11.408
I slept for just a moment,

229
00:24:13.035 --> 00:24:16.372
but it was so beautiful.

230
00:24:17.289 --> 00:24:20.125
Truly.
You are beautiful, you two.

231
00:24:20.793 --> 00:24:23.170
Thank you for saying that.

232
00:24:23.212 --> 00:24:26.423
- Thank you.
- No, I'm thankful.

233
00:24:26.632 --> 00:24:28.759
For the two of you.

234
00:24:28.968 --> 00:24:34.765
I'm thankful for the white snow
that falls upon you.

235
00:24:36.475 --> 00:24:37.768
Thank you.

236
00:24:39.436 --> 00:24:42.815
Doesn't this call for a drink?

237
00:24:43.816 --> 00:24:45.484
You sound like a poet.

238
00:24:45.818 --> 00:24:48.404
Yes, I'm a poet.

239
00:24:51.031 --> 00:24:51.907
Really?

240
00:24:51.949 --> 00:24:57.830
Yes, a real poet.
With a book, even.

241
00:24:58.205 --> 00:24:59.915
Though it's
nothing to brag about.

242
00:24:59.957 --> 00:25:03.210
- She writes great poetry.
- What's your name?

243
00:25:04.169 --> 00:25:06.005
I'm Ko Younghwan.

244
00:25:06.380 --> 00:25:07.840
Ko Younghwan?

245
00:25:09.216 --> 00:25:11.510
I know a poet Ko Younghwan.

246
00:25:11.677 --> 00:25:12.928
It's really you?

247
00:25:13.303 --> 00:25:16.598
Yes, I'm Ko Younghwan.

248
00:25:17.599 --> 00:25:20.561
The one you heard of.

249
00:25:21.812 --> 00:25:23.689
Nice to meet you.

250
00:25:24.606 --> 00:25:29.278
It's so nice to meet you,
at a place like this.

251
00:25:30.154 --> 00:25:33.741
I'm a fan of your work.

252
00:25:34.700 --> 00:25:38.912
Wow, it's amazing, right?

253
00:25:38.954 --> 00:25:42.875
Yes, nice to meet you.
What a surprise.

254
00:25:42.916 --> 00:25:47.504
I was surprised, too.
That you are so beautiful.

255
00:25:47.963 --> 00:25:49.381
Thank you.

256
00:25:51.383 --> 00:25:52.676
Thank you.

257
00:25:53.761 --> 00:25:57.431
For meeting you beautiful people.
I mean it.

258
00:25:58.307 --> 00:25:59.433
Thank you.

259
00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:01.894
- Thank you.
- Yes, thank you.

260
00:26:02.728 --> 00:26:04.188
I mean it.

261
00:26:04.938 --> 00:26:06.482
You're beautiful.

262
00:26:23.415 --> 00:26:25.000
We'll go in, then.

263
00:26:25.125 --> 00:26:27.294
- See you.
- See you later.

264
00:26:27.377 --> 00:26:28.754
For sure!

265
00:26:29.213 --> 00:26:32.424
I hope so.
Have a good day.

266
00:26:33.300 --> 00:26:35.260
You're really beautiful.

267
00:26:37.888 --> 00:26:39.848
- Goodbye!
- Bye.

268
00:27:42.161 --> 00:27:43.036
Dad.

269
00:27:43.370 --> 00:27:45.497
Dad, you're here.

270
00:27:45.789 --> 00:27:46.582
What?

271
00:27:53.505 --> 00:27:55.799
- Why won't it open?
- Is it broken?

272
00:27:55.841 --> 00:27:57.759
- Is it locked?
- Up here.

273
00:27:58.135 --> 00:27:59.428
Right.

274
00:27:59.970 --> 00:28:02.639
- Why are you over here?
- What?

275
00:28:03.473 --> 00:28:04.975
You were here?

276
00:28:05.392 --> 00:28:08.604
We were waiting for you.
You didn't answer.

277
00:28:08.604 --> 00:28:11.565
- I left my phone upstairs.
- Oh, god.

278
00:28:11.607 --> 00:28:13.358
You didn't see me?

279
00:28:13.901 --> 00:28:16.111
Everything's visible from here.

280
00:28:16.278 --> 00:28:18.864
Where were you?
Were you here?

281
00:28:18.906 --> 00:28:20.574
I was down there.

282
00:28:22.451 --> 00:28:23.827
You didn't see me.

283
00:28:23.869 --> 00:28:26.663
We didn't know.
We were worried.

284
00:28:26.747 --> 00:28:29.374
I can't believe it.
Are you okay?

285
00:28:29.416 --> 00:28:30.918
I'm fine.

286
00:28:31.835 --> 00:28:34.630
I kept waiting for you!

287
00:28:34.671 --> 00:28:38.467
- We waited a long time.
- It's true.

288
00:28:40.928 --> 00:28:42.221
Anyway, let's go.

289
00:28:42.262 --> 00:28:43.805
- What?
- To my table.

290
00:28:44.056 --> 00:28:45.766
It's better than here.

291
00:28:45.891 --> 00:28:47.559
- Shall we?
- Yeah.

292
00:28:47.643 --> 00:28:50.771
I missed you, Dad.

293
00:28:52.522 --> 00:28:53.523
Me, too.

294
00:29:05.535 --> 00:29:06.787
Let's go.

295
00:29:07.871 --> 00:29:09.039
Let's go.

296
00:29:11.333 --> 00:29:13.335
- Bring the coffee.
- Okay.

297
00:29:23.553 --> 00:29:28.141
- Then have you been here long?
- About two weeks.

298
00:29:28.517 --> 00:29:31.019
- Wow, that long?
- Yeah.

299
00:29:31.019 --> 00:29:35.190
- How did that happen?
- It was by coincidence.

300
00:29:35.232 --> 00:29:36.316
Coincidence?

301
00:29:36.942 --> 00:29:40.112
Two weeks ago I went to
Itaewon for a drink,

302
00:29:40.362 --> 00:29:42.864
and I met
the owner of this hotel.

303
00:29:43.407 --> 00:29:48.704
He said he had a hotel
on the Han River.

304
00:29:49.288 --> 00:29:54.376
I said,
Really? I'd love to go there.

305
00:29:54.501 --> 00:29:56.712
And he said to come anytime.

306
00:29:57.129 --> 00:30:00.215
That there's a room
Where I can stay for free.

307
00:30:01.008 --> 00:30:03.635
- That's how I came.
- Really?

308
00:30:05.053 --> 00:30:08.015
Otherwise,
I'd never have come.

309
00:30:10.225 --> 00:30:14.521
- You don't have to pay?
- No, it's free.

310
00:30:14.813 --> 00:30:19.067
There are restaurants
across the street, I eat there.

311
00:30:19.109 --> 00:30:21.528
Down the road
are more restaurants.

312
00:30:22.112 --> 00:30:27.034
- But they're expensive.
- Why did he do that for you?

313
00:30:28.035 --> 00:30:33.665
He's read my poetry.
He says he likes me.

314
00:30:34.249 --> 00:30:36.793
He's a good man, really.

315
00:30:37.044 --> 00:30:39.921
That's great.

316
00:30:41.048 --> 00:30:45.218
It seems nice here.
You can rest here.

317
00:30:45.302 --> 00:30:46.261
Yeah.

318
00:30:47.387 --> 00:30:49.431
And write some poems.

319
00:30:50.307 --> 00:30:52.476
I should write more.

320
00:30:55.020 --> 00:30:57.773
It's great to walk
over there.

321
00:30:59.399 --> 00:31:00.400
Yeah.

322
00:31:01.151 --> 00:31:03.445
- This is nice.
- It's great.

323
00:31:06.698 --> 00:31:08.617
I don't want to go home.

324
00:31:09.284 --> 00:31:11.078
There's a cat...

325
00:31:11.119 --> 00:31:13.497
- I have a cat at home.
- Really?

326
00:31:13.622 --> 00:31:15.999
Someone's watching it.

327
00:31:16.249 --> 00:31:20.629
If not for the cat,
I wouldn't go home.

328
00:31:25.842 --> 00:31:27.886
To be honest,

329
00:31:29.262 --> 00:31:31.681
I've been feeling strange here.

330
00:31:32.641 --> 00:31:37.145
I guess that's why
I called the two of you.

331
00:31:38.438 --> 00:31:41.149
- What do you mean?
- What's wrong?

332
00:31:43.527 --> 00:31:46.446
It's really strange.

333
00:31:47.739 --> 00:31:49.199
I keep...

334
00:31:50.450 --> 00:31:53.203
having bad dreams.

335
00:31:53.370 --> 00:31:54.704
At night?

336
00:31:54.871 --> 00:31:57.749
I feel strange in the day too.

337
00:31:59.960 --> 00:32:04.423
Like I'm going to die.
I just feel that way.

338
00:32:05.465 --> 00:32:07.968
It's the first time
I've felt that.

339
00:32:09.678 --> 00:32:12.431
Like I'm going to die
right then.

340
00:32:14.015 --> 00:32:18.437
You've never felt that?
Neither have I.

341
00:32:19.146 --> 00:32:22.023
But is there any
reason for it?

342
00:32:22.899 --> 00:32:25.944
I don't know,
it's just a feeling.

343
00:32:26.111 --> 00:32:28.738
Like I'm going to die.

344
00:32:29.239 --> 00:32:30.657
Tomorrow, even.

345
00:32:33.410 --> 00:32:34.786
Weird, right?

346
00:32:35.537 --> 00:32:39.499
- You don't feel sick anywhere?
- No, I'm fine.

347
00:32:42.252 --> 00:32:43.837
Anyway,

348
00:32:46.006 --> 00:32:48.925
I haven't seen you
in a long time,

349
00:32:48.967 --> 00:32:54.514
and if I'm going to die,
I should see you first.

350
00:33:04.024 --> 00:33:07.360
You're doing all right?

351
00:33:07.944 --> 00:33:09.738
Yes, I am.

352
00:33:10.530 --> 00:33:14.576
So this isn't because
you feel sick?

353
00:33:15.035 --> 00:33:17.454
- I don't feel sick.
- Okay.

354
00:33:17.829 --> 00:33:19.456
I just sense...

355
00:33:20.916 --> 00:33:22.959
it somehow.

356
00:33:26.004 --> 00:33:32.385
So the other day I got a taxi
and took my funeral portrait.

357
00:33:32.886 --> 00:33:35.347
- What?
- You can use it later.

358
00:33:35.889 --> 00:33:40.268
- Really?
- But you look so healthy.

359
00:33:40.936 --> 00:33:43.688
I'm fine,
everything's fine.

360
00:33:45.524 --> 00:33:47.150
Oh my...

361
00:33:50.362 --> 00:33:53.114
Your wife didn't come?
I wanted to see her.

362
00:33:53.156 --> 00:33:55.575
She couldn't make it today.

363
00:33:55.867 --> 00:33:59.204
- She's doing okay?
- She's fine.

364
00:33:59.371 --> 00:34:04.042
She's so nice.
You're so lucky!

365
00:34:04.125 --> 00:34:05.460
Yes, thank you.

366
00:34:05.752 --> 00:34:09.714
She's wonderful.
I'm happy for you.

367
00:34:10.340 --> 00:34:11.967
We're doing fine.

368
00:34:12.592 --> 00:34:16.137
- Be thankful for what you have.
- Yes.

369
00:34:17.931 --> 00:34:20.058
Yes?

370
00:34:20.725 --> 00:34:24.938
- You're not married yet?
- Not yet. I will soon.

371
00:34:26.147 --> 00:34:27.399
Sure.

372
00:34:41.037 --> 00:34:42.539
They...

373
00:34:43.957 --> 00:34:45.917
haven't watered this.

374
00:34:47.794 --> 00:34:50.880
- It looks dry, right?
- Yes.

375
00:34:51.423 --> 00:34:53.049
You're right.

376
00:34:54.092 --> 00:34:56.761
They should water it.

377
00:35:11.610 --> 00:35:12.944
Do you think...

378
00:35:14.279 --> 00:35:16.364
he might be
planning to die?

379
00:35:16.823 --> 00:35:17.741
What?

380
00:35:19.034 --> 00:35:21.286
It looks like
he wants to die.

381
00:35:21.828 --> 00:35:23.663
Why do you think that?

382
00:35:23.913 --> 00:35:27.834
When I look in his face,
it seems that way.

383
00:35:29.294 --> 00:35:31.338
What gives you that idea?

384
00:35:32.547 --> 00:35:36.843
It's like he's just let go
of everything.

385
00:35:38.053 --> 00:35:40.013
You barely know him.

386
00:35:40.430 --> 00:35:42.974
Buffoon, listen to you.

387
00:35:43.058 --> 00:35:44.893
Of course I don't.

388
00:35:46.186 --> 00:35:48.480
I was too young
when he left.

389
00:35:49.522 --> 00:35:51.691
I know him better
than you.

390
00:35:52.025 --> 00:35:54.194
He's a strong person.

391
00:35:56.321 --> 00:35:58.490
<i>Maybe not as strong
as Mom,</i>

392
00:35:58.865 --> 00:36:00.450
but strong.

393
00:36:01.409 --> 00:36:05.830
At his age you can feel that way,
it's no big deal.

394
00:36:07.582 --> 00:36:09.250
- Kyungsoo.
- Yeah?

395
00:36:10.001 --> 00:36:11.836
You won't tell him
you're divorced?

396
00:36:14.047 --> 00:36:15.590
It's better not to.

397
00:36:18.426 --> 00:36:20.720
He doesn't need
to know yet.

398
00:36:39.239 --> 00:36:42.617
Where did he go?
He was smoking out there.

399
00:36:42.867 --> 00:36:44.452
He's not outside.

400
00:36:45.578 --> 00:36:47.247
Did he go to the restroom?

401
00:36:48.206 --> 00:36:49.290
Did he?

402
00:36:49.749 --> 00:36:50.959
That's possible.

403
00:36:58.717 --> 00:37:00.343
Where'd he go?

404
00:37:17.402 --> 00:37:18.528
Dad!

405
00:37:24.701 --> 00:37:25.744
Dad?

406
00:37:47.974 --> 00:37:52.145
Is it possible to
call a guest's room?

407
00:37:52.353 --> 00:37:54.647
You're here to see a guest?

408
00:37:54.814 --> 00:37:56.566
We were together,

409
00:37:56.941 --> 00:38:00.945
but now he's not there.
We were in the coffee shop.

410
00:38:01.237 --> 00:38:04.616
- Could you call his room?
- What's the room number?

411
00:38:05.283 --> 00:38:07.160
I don't know.

412
00:38:07.452 --> 00:38:11.956
You don't?
Then there's not much I can do.

413
00:38:12.665 --> 00:38:17.003
His name is Ko Younghwan.
Do you know him?

414
00:38:17.128 --> 00:38:19.631
Mr. Ko? Of course.

415
00:38:19.756 --> 00:38:22.300
Just a minute, I'll call.

416
00:38:43.488 --> 00:38:45.657
He's not in his room.

417
00:38:47.784 --> 00:38:50.829
- Is he in the restroom?
- I don't know.

418
00:38:51.037 --> 00:38:54.499
- Well, thank you.
- Are you a film director?

419
00:38:54.541 --> 00:38:56.417
I think I've seen you.

420
00:38:57.710 --> 00:38:59.754
Yes, how did you
recognize me?

421
00:38:59.796 --> 00:39:04.425
I've seen you on TV.
It is you!

422
00:39:04.509 --> 00:39:06.261
Nice to meet you.

423
00:39:07.262 --> 00:39:11.266
Would you mind giving me
your autograph?

424
00:39:11.558 --> 00:39:13.142
I haven't prepared one.

425
00:39:15.353 --> 00:39:16.479
Here.

426
00:39:30.159 --> 00:39:33.580
Thank you.
It's a nice looking autograph.

427
00:39:33.830 --> 00:39:35.665
It's just my name.

428
00:39:36.499 --> 00:39:38.668
- Wow.
- Thank you.

429
00:41:08.132 --> 00:41:09.842
<i>I need to send them off.</i>

430
00:41:11.219 --> 00:41:13.054
<i>I have no gift for them.</i>

431
00:41:13.930 --> 00:41:15.807
<i>What do I give them?</i>

432
00:43:22.183 --> 00:43:23.684
Are you asleep?

433
00:43:24.018 --> 00:43:25.061
No.

434
00:43:29.440 --> 00:43:31.984
I love being with you.

435
00:43:32.527 --> 00:43:33.861
Me too.

436
00:43:36.572 --> 00:43:37.615
Thank you.

437
00:43:40.535 --> 00:43:42.453
No, thank you.

438
00:43:45.039 --> 00:43:46.124
Sleep.

439
00:43:47.708 --> 00:43:49.877
You too.

440
00:43:51.170 --> 00:43:52.713
You're not cold?

441
00:43:53.047 --> 00:43:54.715
No, not yet.

442
00:43:56.592 --> 00:43:57.510
Okay.

443
00:44:18.906 --> 00:44:20.658
That's nice.

444
00:44:22.577 --> 00:44:26.330
Isn't it?
They're so cute.

445
00:44:26.539 --> 00:44:27.290
Yeah.

446
00:44:43.097 --> 00:44:45.183
Let's drink.

447
00:44:51.647 --> 00:44:53.816
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

448
00:45:01.032 --> 00:45:03.242
Tastes bad, doesn't it?

449
00:45:04.035 --> 00:45:06.746
Still, it's better than I expected.

450
00:45:08.164 --> 00:45:10.583
At least they sell this.

451
00:45:11.709 --> 00:45:17.757
It looks cheap but it's okay.
Not too sweet.

452
00:45:17.882 --> 00:45:18.549
Yeah.

453
00:45:19.800 --> 00:45:23.679
And the cheese is good, right?

454
00:45:24.055 --> 00:45:25.890
The cheese is good.

455
00:45:38.110 --> 00:45:40.947
There's a magpie nest.
It's huge.

456
00:45:41.822 --> 00:45:43.032
Really?

457
00:45:44.033 --> 00:45:45.785
A magpie nest?

458
00:45:47.411 --> 00:45:49.580
There's a magpie there.

459
00:45:51.290 --> 00:45:53.125
Yes, there is.

460
00:45:58.631 --> 00:46:00.800
It's so impressive.

461
00:46:01.342 --> 00:46:04.512
Building a home in this cold.

462
00:46:04.845 --> 00:46:09.809
- Right, it's so cute.
- Isn't it?

463
00:46:16.899 --> 00:46:18.818
Dad!

464
00:46:25.199 --> 00:46:26.367
Dad!

465
00:46:27.827 --> 00:46:29.954
Where are you?

466
00:46:39.630 --> 00:46:41.465
He's a director.

467
00:46:42.508 --> 00:46:45.219
- What's he doing here?
- A director?

468
00:46:45.469 --> 00:46:47.471
A film director.

469
00:46:48.639 --> 00:46:51.851
That's funny.
What's he doing here?

470
00:46:52.476 --> 00:46:54.228
A film director?

471
00:46:55.146 --> 00:46:57.023
What films did he make?

472
00:46:58.316 --> 00:47:01.027
You wouldn't know them.
They're not your type.

473
00:47:01.402 --> 00:47:02.486
Really?

474
00:47:03.404 --> 00:47:06.365
But his new film did okay.

475
00:47:07.408 --> 00:47:10.161
It did well
for that kind of film.

476
00:47:11.037 --> 00:47:12.788
Is it entertaining?

477
00:47:17.376 --> 00:47:18.210
It's just...

478
00:47:19.587 --> 00:47:21.047
a bit ambivalent.

479
00:47:21.797 --> 00:47:24.592
I know what he's trying to do,

480
00:47:26.218 --> 00:47:28.763
but he doesn't appeal
to the masses,

481
00:47:28.971 --> 00:47:33.434
and he's hardly a real auteur.

482
00:47:34.602 --> 00:47:37.521
He just seems very diligent.

483
00:47:38.356 --> 00:47:40.316
That's my impression.

484
00:47:42.568 --> 00:47:44.737
- Sounds boring.
- Dad!

485
00:47:45.613 --> 00:47:48.783
You're right.
He's ambivalent.

486
00:47:50.659 --> 00:47:54.955
Maybe his father has dementia.

487
00:47:55.289 --> 00:47:58.209
It's possible. Maybe.

488
00:47:59.543 --> 00:48:01.712
He's a devoted son, right?

489
00:48:02.380 --> 00:48:04.256
He seems to be.

490
00:48:04.882 --> 00:48:06.675
He's so fervent.

491
00:48:09.345 --> 00:48:10.763
Aren't you tired?

492
00:48:13.516 --> 00:48:14.934
A little.

493
00:48:15.142 --> 00:48:16.477
Lie down.

494
00:48:17.812 --> 00:48:18.562
Okay.

495
00:48:21.732 --> 00:48:23.901
We lie down all day long.

496
00:48:24.235 --> 00:48:26.779
- You don't like it?
- I like it.

497
00:48:27.196 --> 00:48:28.489
Then let's lie down.

498
00:48:52.471 --> 00:48:54.640
Dad!

499
00:49:14.577 --> 00:49:15.536
Dad.

500
00:49:20.166 --> 00:49:21.667
What's that?

501
00:49:21.876 --> 00:49:24.420
This one
I won as a prize,

502
00:49:24.712 --> 00:49:26.922
and this was a gift
from a woman.

503
00:49:27.673 --> 00:49:28.757
Yeah.

504
00:49:29.341 --> 00:49:30.426
Cute.

505
00:49:31.844 --> 00:49:35.181
This is you,
and this is Byungsoo.

506
00:49:35.890 --> 00:49:37.057
Really?

507
00:49:39.143 --> 00:49:40.728
Where'd he go?

508
00:49:40.936 --> 00:49:44.023
He went looking for you.
Here he is.

509
00:49:44.190 --> 00:49:45.024
Hey!

510
00:49:45.524 --> 00:49:46.400
Dad's here.

511
00:49:46.650 --> 00:49:47.735
Come here.

512
00:49:50.946 --> 00:49:52.615
Hey, where were you?

513
00:49:52.698 --> 00:49:53.991
To the restroom.

514
00:49:54.033 --> 00:49:56.535
Then I walked around
and went outside.

515
00:49:56.577 --> 00:49:57.453
Did you?

516
00:49:57.870 --> 00:50:00.664
Why do you look so upset?

517
00:50:01.457 --> 00:50:04.502
- Me? Upset?
- A bit.

518
00:50:05.419 --> 00:50:06.921
You know who this is?

519
00:50:08.047 --> 00:50:09.006
No.

520
00:50:09.381 --> 00:50:12.843
This is you,
and this is Kyungsoo.

521
00:50:13.677 --> 00:50:16.388
Really?
Where'd you get them?

522
00:50:17.389 --> 00:50:20.559
From a prize machine.
And a gift from a woman.

523
00:50:21.727 --> 00:50:23.229
I'm a woman?

524
00:50:23.312 --> 00:50:24.605
It's pretty!

525
00:50:25.022 --> 00:50:28.108
You're pretty,
with your slender body.

526
00:50:28.150 --> 00:50:33.239
Right, he could've been a dancer
with that body.

527
00:50:33.656 --> 00:50:36.033
I wanted to be a dancer,
<i>as</i> a kid.

528
00:50:36.784 --> 00:50:40.120
- Really?
- But I thought people would laugh.

529
00:50:40.746 --> 00:50:41.747
You did?

530
00:50:42.665 --> 00:50:45.167
I really wanted to dance.

531
00:50:46.001 --> 00:50:49.004
Really?
I never knew that.

532
00:50:49.547 --> 00:50:51.715
These are for you.
Take them.

533
00:50:51.924 --> 00:50:52.967
Thanks.

534
00:50:53.008 --> 00:50:55.636
- You're giving them to us?
- Sure.

535
00:50:57.179 --> 00:50:59.890
Looking at these
will cheer you up.

536
00:51:00.224 --> 00:51:03.143
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

537
00:51:03.811 --> 00:51:05.688
They suit you perfectly.

538
00:51:05.729 --> 00:51:06.564
Do they?

539
00:51:06.730 --> 00:51:09.567
- I'm a pig!
- Is that a pig?

540
00:51:09.817 --> 00:51:10.859
- What is mine?
- What is yours?

541
00:51:10.901 --> 00:51:11.986
- Let me see.
- I don't know.

542
00:51:12.027 --> 00:51:14.071
- Let me take a photo.
- A photo?

543
00:51:14.113 --> 00:51:15.030
Yes.

544
00:51:17.032 --> 00:51:19.743
- With dolls?
- Yes, hold them.

545
00:51:20.911 --> 00:51:22.037
Smile.

546
00:51:26.667 --> 00:51:27.876
How is it?

547
00:51:28.752 --> 00:51:31.630
Look.
Great, huh?

548
00:51:31.672 --> 00:51:35.217
Yeah, be sure to...
Don't...

549
00:51:35.384 --> 00:51:36.594
Don't delete it.

550
00:51:36.635 --> 00:51:38.971
- This is hilarious.
- Isn't it?

551
00:51:39.305 --> 00:51:41.181
This is crazy!

552
00:51:41.223 --> 00:51:44.476
You think?
It really is crazy.

553
00:51:58.949 --> 00:52:02.286
You can write your name
in Chinese characters?

554
00:52:02.536 --> 00:52:04.622
- Sure.
- Try it.

555
00:52:05.539 --> 00:52:07.833
- In Chinese characters?
- Yes, try it.

556
00:52:15.382 --> 00:52:16.800
You know its meaning?

557
00:52:17.009 --> 00:52:18.010
Yes.

558
00:52:19.803 --> 00:52:23.515
Wow, my son writes well!

559
00:52:23.557 --> 00:52:25.559
- Really?
- Yeah.

560
00:52:25.643 --> 00:52:28.187
Thank you.
I don't have much practice.

561
00:52:29.146 --> 00:52:31.398
- You're good at writing.
- Really?

562
00:52:31.440 --> 00:52:33.025
I haven't practiced much.

563
00:52:33.484 --> 00:52:36.487
- No, you're good.
- Really?

564
00:52:37.571 --> 00:52:39.740
You know who named you?

565
00:52:40.658 --> 00:52:43.577
- It was you, wasn't it?
- That's right.

566
00:52:44.036 --> 00:52:46.413
- You know these characters?
- Yes.

567
00:52:46.497 --> 00:52:48.540
Byung is side by side,
soo is excellence.

568
00:52:48.916 --> 00:52:52.795
But why did
you name him that?

569
00:52:53.253 --> 00:52:55.756
For you, Kyung, Seoul,
soo excellence.

570
00:52:55.798 --> 00:52:58.008
I know that.
I was born in Seoul

571
00:52:58.050 --> 00:52:59.927
so you used that character.

572
00:53:00.469 --> 00:53:04.973
As the top city,
Seoul represents good fortune.

573
00:53:05.182 --> 00:53:06.308
And me?

574
00:53:06.975 --> 00:53:09.186
Byung, side by side.

575
00:53:09.937 --> 00:53:12.022
That has two meanings.

576
00:53:12.314 --> 00:53:13.232
Two meanings?

577
00:53:13.941 --> 00:53:15.025
First,

578
00:53:15.901 --> 00:53:21.448
for you and your brother
to stay close all of your lives.

579
00:53:23.951 --> 00:53:25.411
It has that meaning?

580
00:53:26.453 --> 00:53:27.830
Second,

581
00:53:29.581 --> 00:53:32.126
you are of two minds.

582
00:53:32.501 --> 00:53:33.877
Two minds?

583
00:53:33.961 --> 00:53:37.589
The first is a mind
that feels heaven.

584
00:53:38.298 --> 00:53:41.885
And the second
walks on the street.

585
00:53:42.761 --> 00:53:47.933
To live well, those two minds
should go side by side.

586
00:53:52.813 --> 00:53:53.939
So,

587
00:53:54.440 --> 00:53:57.025
what is a mind
that feels heaven?

588
00:53:59.194 --> 00:54:03.115
When we're born,
we belong to heaven.

589
00:54:03.866 --> 00:54:06.493
When we live,
and even after we die.

590
00:54:07.244 --> 00:54:09.496
We belong to heaven.

591
00:54:09.955 --> 00:54:11.874
That's why we feel heaven.

592
00:54:12.541 --> 00:54:13.751
It's simple.

593
00:54:14.376 --> 00:54:17.504
We are of heaven,
and so we can feel it.

594
00:54:17.713 --> 00:54:19.548
That's poetry.

595
00:54:21.467 --> 00:54:25.137
If you can't feel that,
it's no different from being dead.

596
00:54:26.305 --> 00:54:28.932
What about a mind
walking on the street?

597
00:54:29.433 --> 00:54:33.729
If you're born human,
you must act like one.

598
00:54:34.104 --> 00:54:35.355
You have to learn.

599
00:54:36.023 --> 00:54:39.610
You're of heaven,
but you must learn to be human.

600
00:54:39.943 --> 00:54:43.363
Otherwise you die,
people will kill you.

601
00:54:45.282 --> 00:54:49.328
If one mind gets too strong,
it wants to erase the other.

602
00:54:49.703 --> 00:54:51.371
Don't let that happen.

603
00:54:51.872 --> 00:54:55.417
Even if the strong mind
becomes irritated by the other,

604
00:54:55.459 --> 00:54:58.378
have them
go forward side by side,

605
00:54:58.796 --> 00:55:01.548
that's Byung, side by side.

606
00:55:03.217 --> 00:55:05.302
Both of them are yours.

607
00:55:06.386 --> 00:55:07.471
Understand?

608
00:55:10.891 --> 00:55:14.561
Dad, let me write this down.

609
00:55:18.690 --> 00:55:20.108
Byung, side by side.

610
00:55:21.318 --> 00:55:24.112
There's more meaning
in Byung than in Kyung.

611
00:55:26.031 --> 00:55:28.617
- Shall I write my name too?
- Yes.

612
00:55:44.132 --> 00:55:47.970
- Wow, you're a calligrapher!
- Really?

613
00:55:48.637 --> 00:55:50.514
You and your brother both.

614
00:56:02.234 --> 00:56:06.363
- Sorry to interrupt you.
- No, it's fine.

615
00:56:06.572 --> 00:56:08.240
But what is it?

616
00:56:08.282 --> 00:56:12.327
My boss is outside,
and he'd like a word with you.

617
00:56:12.411 --> 00:56:14.538
He said it'll take
two minutes.

618
00:56:15.038 --> 00:56:18.208
- Two minutes?
- That's what he said.

619
00:56:19.376 --> 00:56:20.502
All right, then.

620
00:56:21.503 --> 00:56:23.422
He's by the front door?

621
00:56:23.463 --> 00:56:26.049
- Yes, he'll be there.
- Okay.

622
00:56:26.133 --> 00:56:27.009
And...

623
00:56:28.802 --> 00:56:30.470
Is that your son?

624
00:56:31.680 --> 00:56:34.808
Yes, it is.
Do you know him?

625
00:56:34.975 --> 00:56:37.436
Sure, he's a film director.

626
00:56:38.770 --> 00:56:40.105
Yes, that's right.

627
00:56:41.565 --> 00:56:43.901
- Okay, then.
- Okay.

628
00:57:58.058 --> 00:57:59.935
What are you thinking?

629
00:58:03.772 --> 00:58:07.150
I was wondering
what he's doing,

630
00:58:08.610 --> 00:58:12.030
what's he's doing
at this moment.

631
00:58:15.534 --> 00:58:19.037
I'm sure he's doing fine.
Don't worry.

632
00:58:20.414 --> 00:58:21.999
I guess so.

633
00:58:23.750 --> 00:58:26.753
It's mealtime,
so he's probably eaten.

634
00:58:30.340 --> 00:58:32.509
Is it lunchtime?

635
00:58:32.884 --> 00:58:37.055
It's past lunchtime.
We need to eat dinner.

636
00:58:38.932 --> 00:58:41.059
Yes, we should eat.

637
00:58:44.104 --> 00:58:47.274
I dreamed of him,

638
00:58:47.816 --> 00:58:50.777
and he asked me
to cook soybean stew.

639
00:58:52.320 --> 00:58:56.158
He used to love it
when I cooked that.

640
00:58:57.951 --> 00:59:01.747
Whatever I made,
he said was delicious.

641
00:59:03.498 --> 00:59:04.708
Did he?

642
00:59:06.585 --> 00:59:10.505
I feel bad for him now.

643
00:59:12.758 --> 00:59:14.676
I understand everything.

644
00:59:16.553 --> 00:59:19.347
I just hope he's happy.

645
00:59:22.476 --> 00:59:23.477
You do?

646
00:59:27.814 --> 00:59:28.648
Yes.

647
00:59:30.358 --> 00:59:31.359
I guess...

648
00:59:32.736 --> 00:59:34.446
he was scared.

649
00:59:36.031 --> 00:59:37.783
Thinking about it,

650
00:59:39.618 --> 00:59:40.869
I pity him.

651
00:59:41.119 --> 00:59:42.537
Forget that.

652
00:59:43.288 --> 00:59:47.542
He's probably living it up
at home with his wife.

653
00:59:48.585 --> 00:59:50.295
I don't mind,

654
00:59:50.879 --> 00:59:52.881
if he's happy...

655
00:59:55.175 --> 00:59:57.010
Oh, my.

656
01:00:00.222 --> 01:00:02.891
He worried so much.

657
01:00:04.476 --> 01:00:08.396
- Couldn't sleep at night.
- Who? Him?

658
01:00:09.356 --> 01:00:12.192
I think he thought too much.

659
01:00:13.693 --> 01:00:17.114
That's why his heart cooled.

660
01:00:19.032 --> 01:00:21.952
He thought too much.

661
01:00:24.037 --> 01:00:25.580
Is that it?

662
01:00:28.166 --> 01:00:31.419
He used his head too much.

663
01:00:34.172 --> 01:00:37.467
So his heart became
frozen with fear.

664
01:00:40.512 --> 01:00:42.597
What was he so scared of?

665
01:00:43.890 --> 01:00:45.600
Failure?

666
01:00:47.185 --> 01:00:49.604
Having his life fall apart?

667
01:00:53.692 --> 01:00:55.360
I guess he thought...

668
01:00:56.945 --> 01:01:00.073
if he lived with me,
he'd fail.

669
01:01:01.616 --> 01:01:04.244
So he kept agonizing

670
01:01:05.412 --> 01:01:09.332
over how to avoid that.

671
01:01:10.500 --> 01:01:12.919
He wore himself out.

672
01:01:15.380 --> 01:01:19.176
Later he became numb,

673
01:01:20.218 --> 01:01:22.304
and got depressed,

674
01:01:22.429 --> 01:01:23.847
then one day

675
01:01:25.724 --> 01:01:28.560
he ended it just like that.

676
01:01:28.643 --> 01:01:31.021
So what did he lose?

677
01:01:32.022 --> 01:01:34.065
You suffered so much.

678
01:01:34.649 --> 01:01:37.235
It's heartless what he did.

679
01:01:37.402 --> 01:01:39.571
Perhaps.

680
01:01:41.698 --> 01:01:44.201
I didn't lose anything.

681
01:01:45.368 --> 01:01:47.954
I just suffered a bit.

682
01:01:49.956 --> 01:01:51.666
You sure did.

683
01:01:58.798 --> 01:02:03.053
I feel bad for him now.

684
01:02:09.935 --> 01:02:12.646
Should we eat
before it's too late?

685
01:02:14.147 --> 01:02:15.357
Sure.

686
01:02:16.441 --> 01:02:18.235
After the sun sets.

687
01:02:20.904 --> 01:02:22.948
After the sun sets.

688
01:02:28.036 --> 01:02:30.163
Want to hear something funny?

689
01:02:30.580 --> 01:02:32.582
Yes, what is it?

690
01:02:32.958 --> 01:02:34.709
I stole something.

691
01:02:34.918 --> 01:02:36.044
Really?

692
01:02:37.837 --> 01:02:39.547
A pair of gloves.

693
01:02:40.048 --> 01:02:41.174
From where?

694
01:02:41.216 --> 01:02:44.052
When I arrived,
earlier today.

695
01:02:45.053 --> 01:02:46.972
I stole it from some car.

696
01:02:47.555 --> 01:02:50.558
What for?
Why steal gloves?

697
01:02:50.600 --> 01:02:52.185
I don't know.

698
01:02:54.312 --> 01:02:56.439
Are you a kleptomaniac?

699
01:02:58.566 --> 01:03:00.151
It's not that!

700
01:03:02.821 --> 01:03:04.322
I think

701
01:03:05.615 --> 01:03:08.994
it's the same car
I had the accident in.

702
01:03:09.828 --> 01:03:11.329
That's why I stole.

703
01:03:12.914 --> 01:03:17.210
The car you crashed?
That car is here?

704
01:03:18.211 --> 01:03:20.422
It's exactly the same.

705
01:03:21.923 --> 01:03:26.928
Jacked-up the same way,
with the same interior.

706
01:03:29.848 --> 01:03:33.601
But the smashed part in front
is fixed up like new.

707
01:03:34.144 --> 01:03:36.354
I don't know how.

708
01:03:37.480 --> 01:03:40.900
So you stole gloves without
knowing the owner?

709
01:03:41.151 --> 01:03:43.486
It's because I didn't know!

710
01:03:46.364 --> 01:03:49.951
That car is out in front?

711
01:03:50.744 --> 01:03:51.578
Yeah.

712
01:03:52.329 --> 01:03:53.621
It's really that car.

713
01:03:54.622 --> 01:03:55.540
Want to see?

714
01:03:56.833 --> 01:03:57.792
Come here.

715
01:03:58.418 --> 01:03:59.961
Might still be there.

716
01:04:05.884 --> 01:04:06.968
It's gone.

717
01:04:08.887 --> 01:04:10.513
- It's not there?
- No.

718
01:04:11.389 --> 01:04:13.350
It must have gone.

719
01:04:15.977 --> 01:04:18.813
Then we can't
return the gloves.

720
01:04:21.191 --> 01:04:22.484
I guess not.

721
01:04:28.365 --> 01:04:31.785
- We could drive there.
- Let's walk.

722
01:04:33.203 --> 01:04:36.289
If we walk a bit,
we can find many restaurants.

723
01:04:36.581 --> 01:04:37.415
Yeah.

724
01:04:37.957 --> 01:04:40.168
They said
it's a five minute walk.

725
01:04:41.211 --> 01:04:42.337
Let's walk.

726
01:04:43.671 --> 01:04:47.842
I want to walk,
after lying down all day.

727
01:04:48.259 --> 01:04:49.552
Sure, let's do that.

728
01:04:52.180 --> 01:04:53.556
This is nice.

729
01:04:54.057 --> 01:04:54.974
Isn't it?

730
01:04:55.809 --> 01:04:56.726
Yeah.

731
01:05:00.563 --> 01:05:04.317
- Not too cold, right?
- No, it isn't.

732
01:05:05.026 --> 01:05:06.319
It's fine.

733
01:05:13.451 --> 01:05:14.661
It's so cold!

734
01:05:14.786 --> 01:05:17.497
Let's go in anywhere.
I'm freezing!

735
01:05:17.539 --> 01:05:20.250
So cold!
We should've taken the car.

736
01:05:20.375 --> 01:05:22.335
Want to go in here?

737
01:05:27.507 --> 01:05:28.800
The car is here?

738
01:05:30.718 --> 01:05:32.554
This is my car.

739
01:05:32.887 --> 01:05:34.431
It really is.

740
01:05:35.056 --> 01:05:37.142
It was here.

741
01:05:38.309 --> 01:05:39.769
They must be inside.

742
01:05:40.228 --> 01:05:43.565
- Should we go in?
- Sure, it looks tasty.

743
01:05:44.566 --> 01:05:48.027
- Tofu would taste good.
- Great, let's eat!

744
01:05:49.362 --> 01:05:50.738
Are you happy?

745
01:06:05.920 --> 01:06:07.964
You look happy, suddenly.

746
01:06:08.882 --> 01:06:12.260
- I look happy?
- What happened to you?

747
01:06:13.678 --> 01:06:17.765
You looked upset,
but then suddenly you changed.

748
01:06:17.807 --> 01:06:18.808
Did I?

749
01:06:18.933 --> 01:06:22.270
It's strange.
Your mood lifted all of a sudden.

750
01:06:23.563 --> 01:06:25.106
I guess so.

751
01:06:26.357 --> 01:06:27.901
Anyway, that's good.

752
01:06:29.444 --> 01:06:30.320
Dad.

753
01:06:30.778 --> 01:06:32.906
Forget about the hotel owner.

754
01:06:32.947 --> 01:06:35.658
- It's okay, I'm fine.
- Yes, yes.

755
01:06:36.284 --> 01:06:41.956
- So you'll move out tomorrow?
- Yes, tomorrow if possible.

756
01:06:42.332 --> 01:06:45.710
- Just move out tomorrow.
- Would you like to come to my house?

757
01:06:49.672 --> 01:06:50.965
As for that...

758
01:06:57.931 --> 01:07:02.227
There's something the owner
said to me at the end.

759
01:07:02.352 --> 01:07:02.936
Yes?

760
01:07:04.896 --> 01:07:05.855
What did he say?

761
01:07:06.231 --> 01:07:08.274
That his heart
no longer trembled.

762
01:07:08.441 --> 01:07:13.988
At first his heart
trembled out of respect,

763
01:07:14.030 --> 01:07:16.616
but now
it's completely gone.

764
01:07:18.660 --> 01:07:20.828
- He doesn't tremble now?
- Right.

765
01:07:25.667 --> 01:07:30.838
He said he had a lot to say to me,
but he'd forget it.

766
01:07:30.922 --> 01:07:33.049
That he'd just forget it.

767
01:07:34.467 --> 01:07:39.389
- What's he going to forget?
- I don't know.

768
01:07:39.681 --> 01:07:43.017
How should I know
what he wants to forget?

769
01:07:43.476 --> 01:07:45.895
It seems his feelings were hurt.

770
01:07:46.854 --> 01:07:48.147
I guess.

771
01:07:51.693 --> 01:07:53.778
You must have felt upset.

772
01:07:56.489 --> 01:08:01.160
By any chance, did you
do anything wrong at the hotel?

773
01:08:02.912 --> 01:08:04.581
- Anything wrong?
- Yeah.

774
01:08:05.540 --> 01:08:08.710
I'm not sure.
I don't know.

775
01:08:09.210 --> 01:08:10.712
What could I have done?

776
01:08:17.218 --> 01:08:21.639
What could you have done?
Right?

777
01:08:21.681 --> 01:08:24.225
- Yes.
- He wouldn't do anything.

778
01:08:25.810 --> 01:08:31.232
I'd talk with him,
and we'd drink together.

779
01:08:31.274 --> 01:08:32.400
But...

780
01:08:34.319 --> 01:08:39.532
I got tired of him.
He always says the same thing.

781
01:08:43.453 --> 01:08:46.539
So I turned down drinks
a few times.

782
01:08:47.040 --> 01:08:49.917
And once he invited me
to Mt. Songni,

783
01:08:50.793 --> 01:08:53.254
but I said no.

784
01:08:54.464 --> 01:08:56.007
Was that why?

785
01:08:56.382 --> 01:08:58.259
Yes, it could be.

786
01:08:58.676 --> 01:09:02.639
He gave you a hotel room,
and wanted to spend time with you.

787
01:09:02.680 --> 01:09:03.222
Right.

788
01:09:03.264 --> 01:09:07.894
Well, maybe not.
He was pleasant and well-mannered.

789
01:09:07.894 --> 01:09:13.107
He told his employees
to be careful not to disturb me.

790
01:09:13.149 --> 01:09:14.442
- Really?
- Yeah.

791
01:09:15.777 --> 01:09:19.906
- He trembled in front of you?
- Yeah.

792
01:09:21.282 --> 01:09:23.034
But not anymore!

793
01:09:25.161 --> 01:09:29.957
It seems he liked Dad a lot.

794
01:09:30.500 --> 01:09:31.292
I think so.

795
01:09:31.334 --> 01:09:32.293
I guess so.

796
01:09:33.753 --> 01:09:36.047
Then why is
he acting this way?

797
01:09:37.048 --> 01:09:38.341
I don't know.

798
01:09:41.969 --> 01:09:44.222
- Everything changes.
- That's right, it does.

799
01:09:44.263 --> 01:09:45.556
Yes,yes.

800
01:09:58.194 --> 01:09:59.612
Looks like they're leaving.

801
01:10:02.031 --> 01:10:04.826
I guess so.
They drank a lot.

802
01:10:07.412 --> 01:10:10.581
- Should I get an autograph?
- From who?

803
01:10:11.666 --> 01:10:12.792
The director?

804
01:10:13.668 --> 01:10:17.130
Yeah, and the poet too.
They'll like it.

805
01:10:18.673 --> 01:10:21.300
Why don't we just
leave them alone?

806
01:10:22.844 --> 01:10:23.845
You think?

807
01:10:31.185 --> 01:10:34.439
I guess they're father and son.
Surprising, isn't it?

808
01:10:35.273 --> 01:10:36.107
Yeah.

809
01:10:37.316 --> 01:10:39.193
He called him Dad.

810
01:10:40.111 --> 01:10:41.946
And they drive my car!

811
01:10:43.197 --> 01:10:44.574
That's so funny.

812
01:10:45.658 --> 01:10:46.743
It's amazing.

813
01:10:49.495 --> 01:10:51.581
But now it's their car.

814
01:10:54.208 --> 01:10:56.294
I'll get an autograph,
before they go.

815
01:10:56.419 --> 01:10:57.712
No, don't.

816
01:10:58.045 --> 01:11:01.048
- You'll annoy them.
- No, they'll like it.

817
01:11:01.883 --> 01:11:05.386
He's a really important director.
He's hot now.

818
01:11:05.762 --> 01:11:06.637
Really?

819
01:11:08.055 --> 01:11:09.974
Didn't you call him ambivalent?

820
01:11:10.933 --> 01:11:13.895
He's hot, really.

821
01:11:14.479 --> 01:11:18.024
Everyone likes him.
What can I do?

822
01:11:19.025 --> 01:11:21.360
What will you do with it?

823
01:11:22.904 --> 01:11:24.197
You like autographs?

824
01:11:28.409 --> 01:11:29.702
I'm going to get it.

825
01:11:30.661 --> 01:11:31.662
I want to.

826
01:11:31.996 --> 01:11:33.289
Wait a minute.

827
01:11:34.040 --> 01:11:34.874
Why?

828
01:11:36.042 --> 01:11:39.253
It's embarrassing.
Why am I embarrassed?

829
01:11:39.378 --> 01:11:42.048
What's embarrassing
about an autograph?

830
01:11:43.674 --> 01:11:46.344
They're not leaving yet, wait.

831
01:11:51.182 --> 01:11:53.184
Why does it bother you?

832
01:11:53.810 --> 01:11:55.102
It's strange.

833
01:12:26.801 --> 01:12:28.344
Do you have a girlfriend?

834
01:12:29.637 --> 01:12:32.473
I don't have a girlfriend.

835
01:12:34.267 --> 01:12:35.893
He doesn't date women.

836
01:12:36.394 --> 01:12:41.023
Or he dates them,
but not for love.

837
01:12:42.567 --> 01:12:43.860
Really?

838
01:12:45.152 --> 01:12:49.949
I'm scared of them.
I've had some bad experiences.

839
01:12:50.032 --> 01:12:51.534
Women are frightening.

840
01:12:51.701 --> 01:12:54.745
What women?
What experiences?

841
01:12:55.413 --> 01:12:57.039
Why are you scared of women?

842
01:12:58.916 --> 01:13:02.461
I can't trust them.
I've seen too many cases.

843
01:13:05.047 --> 01:13:07.758
You're just crazy!

844
01:13:09.719 --> 01:13:14.932
How many women have you met
to think that way?

845
01:13:15.308 --> 01:13:19.437
- What are you talking about?
- Dad, keep your voice down.

846
01:13:19.520 --> 01:13:19.896
What?

847
01:13:19.937 --> 01:13:23.357
If you speak so loud,
everyone can hear.

848
01:13:24.775 --> 01:13:26.777
Okay, I'll speak quietly.

849
01:13:27.904 --> 01:13:32.742
I think Mom's had some influence
on him, and me too.

850
01:13:33.701 --> 01:13:35.244
What do you mean, on you?

851
01:13:37.622 --> 01:13:39.123
Do you hate women?

852
01:13:39.832 --> 01:13:41.918
Do you like them or not?

853
01:13:43.961 --> 01:13:48.132
I need to think more about
my feelings for women.

854
01:13:49.967 --> 01:13:52.887
I deal with them cautiously.

855
01:13:53.512 --> 01:13:56.140
Wow, that's what you're like?

856
01:13:57.725 --> 01:13:59.477
It's because of Mom?

857
01:14:01.312 --> 01:14:02.647
Is that it?

858
01:14:02.939 --> 01:14:05.566
What?
I don't know for sure.

859
01:14:06.150 --> 01:14:09.987
But Mom is so overpowering,
he's been daunted by her...

860
01:14:10.029 --> 01:14:13.115
Who says I'm daunted
by Mom?

861
01:14:18.746 --> 01:14:23.167
It's because
I loved her sincerely.

862
01:14:23.250 --> 01:14:26.462
Is there anything wrong
with that?

863
01:14:28.130 --> 01:14:30.967
Sure, you love Mom.

864
01:14:31.509 --> 01:14:33.636
You're your mother's son.

865
01:14:35.304 --> 01:14:36.347
Dad.

866
01:14:37.598 --> 01:14:40.518
How can you say that?

867
01:14:41.602 --> 01:14:43.479
You're your mother's son.

868
01:14:43.688 --> 01:14:46.440
I've always known.
It's okay.

869
01:14:46.607 --> 01:14:47.441
Dad!

870
01:14:47.733 --> 01:14:53.447
As much as I'm her son,
I'm your son too!

871
01:14:53.489 --> 01:14:55.992
- Do you know?
- Calm down.

872
01:14:56.158 --> 01:14:58.369
Why are you shouting?
Stop it.

873
01:14:58.703 --> 01:15:02.623
- I'm going crazy, Dad!
- Stop it.

874
01:15:03.207 --> 01:15:06.377
Be good to your Mom, okay?

875
01:15:10.589 --> 01:15:12.633
- That's good enough.
- Yeah.

876
01:15:16.679 --> 01:15:18.848
How's your Mom doing?

877
01:15:19.932 --> 01:15:21.017
Mom?

878
01:15:22.560 --> 01:15:24.687
Same as always, she's fine.

879
01:15:26.897 --> 01:15:29.859
Does she still curse me,
every day?

880
01:15:31.402 --> 01:15:35.573
She doesn't curse, but she calls
you a piece of shit, every day.

881
01:15:36.532 --> 01:15:42.038
A total monster without
a single redeeming human virtue.

882
01:15:42.121 --> 01:15:44.498
In her words,
that about sums it up.

883
01:15:44.540 --> 01:15:45.416
Let go of me.

884
01:15:45.458 --> 01:15:46.542
Really?

885
01:15:49.003 --> 01:15:51.714
I asked her once, for real.

886
01:15:52.256 --> 01:15:57.553
I said, tell me just
one good thing about him.

887
01:15:57.636 --> 01:16:03.726
But she immediately shot back,
there's nothing at all.

888
01:16:04.894 --> 01:16:08.898
So you're just
a total monster, Dad.

889
01:16:09.899 --> 01:16:13.277
The worst human on earth.
Until you die.

890
01:16:14.653 --> 01:16:15.529
The end.

891
01:16:16.405 --> 01:16:18.699
She's the same as always.

892
01:16:24.205 --> 01:16:25.039
Dad.

893
01:16:27.249 --> 01:16:31.879
Why did you
dislike her so much?

894
01:16:34.548 --> 01:16:37.718
We just didn't suit each other.

895
01:16:38.594 --> 01:16:41.180
We got married too young.

896
01:16:43.432 --> 01:16:49.563
I was wretched and poor,
so I liked a lot of things about her.

897
01:16:50.898 --> 01:16:53.776
But we were never
right for each other.

898
01:16:57.363 --> 01:17:04.870
Even still, how could you
abandon us so easily?

899
01:17:04.912 --> 01:17:06.205
Easily?

900
01:17:06.872 --> 01:17:11.335
You got up and left
just like that,

901
01:17:11.710 --> 01:17:13.170
from what I heard.

902
01:17:14.713 --> 01:17:20.594
What do you mean, easily?
I wrestled with it a lot!

903
01:17:20.636 --> 01:17:23.013
But what I realized is,

904
01:17:25.724 --> 01:17:29.645
you can't live your life
based on guilt.

905
01:17:31.897 --> 01:17:35.109
People need to follow
real love.

906
01:17:37.278 --> 01:17:39.947
Even if you fail in that love...

907
01:17:41.782 --> 01:17:44.910
And I failed, you know that.

908
01:17:48.247 --> 01:17:51.709
You can't keep living
with someone out of guilt.

909
01:17:52.793 --> 01:17:55.045
That's why I left.

910
01:17:57.173 --> 01:18:05.264
But you and that woman,
you two broke up.

911
01:18:08.100 --> 01:18:11.604
She dumped me!
Later she stopped liking me.

912
01:18:13.105 --> 01:18:14.732
Still, that's okay.

913
01:18:16.734 --> 01:18:19.361
Being abandoned
doesn't change anything.

914
01:18:20.779 --> 01:18:24.200
Thanks to that,
I experienced love.

915
01:18:26.869 --> 01:18:28.162
It's okay.

916
01:18:29.914 --> 01:18:31.832
What are you scared of?

917
01:18:31.957 --> 01:18:35.669
You'll die before long,
don't forget!

918
01:18:37.880 --> 01:18:39.381
Yes, it's true.

919
01:18:44.261 --> 01:18:45.638
You're okay.

920
01:18:46.347 --> 01:18:48.349
You've got a nice girl.

921
01:18:50.684 --> 01:18:53.479
Yes, it's true.

922
01:19:04.949 --> 01:19:06.951
I'm stuffed.
I ate so much.

923
01:19:09.203 --> 01:19:11.372
I'm glad everything
was tasty.

924
01:19:11.664 --> 01:19:13.249
Why am I eating so much?

925
01:19:13.916 --> 01:19:14.917
Good question.

926
01:19:21.966 --> 01:19:23.884
Why do they get so
worked up?

927
01:19:25.761 --> 01:19:27.805
What do they know
about love?

928
01:19:29.348 --> 01:19:34.603
By nature, men are just
incapable of grasping love.

929
01:19:35.521 --> 01:19:37.022
They're so immature.

930
01:19:37.564 --> 01:19:39.191
All their lives.

931
01:19:40.943 --> 01:19:44.029
Then what are we
supposed to do?

932
01:19:45.197 --> 01:19:47.449
But sometimes
you find an exception.

933
01:19:49.118 --> 01:19:50.953
My husband is different.

934
01:19:51.620 --> 01:19:52.496
Really?

935
01:19:54.039 --> 01:19:57.501
You know how picky I am.

936
01:20:00.379 --> 01:20:06.635
So I can't stand it
when men act immature.

937
01:20:07.177 --> 01:20:10.681
But when I met my husband,
he wasn't like that at all.

938
01:20:13.309 --> 01:20:14.226
Really.

939
01:20:14.268 --> 01:20:17.021
I'm glad there are
at least some.

940
01:20:17.980 --> 01:20:22.026
But there aren't many.

941
01:20:22.318 --> 01:20:23.944
They're so rare.

942
01:20:24.737 --> 01:20:26.405
Don't you think?

943
01:20:28.866 --> 01:20:33.412
When I think of what he did,

944
01:20:33.454 --> 01:20:34.747
I can't forgive him.

945
01:20:36.540 --> 01:20:40.419
But I don't believe
I'm any better.

946
01:20:43.297 --> 01:20:44.715
The way I see it,

947
01:20:45.591 --> 01:20:49.386
we each tried our best,

948
01:20:49.511 --> 01:20:52.431
but it just wasn't enough.

949
01:20:57.936 --> 01:21:00.856
In the end,
we're self-centered.

950
01:21:01.273 --> 01:21:02.858
I don't agree.

951
01:21:03.609 --> 01:21:07.571
Men are different.
Except men like my husband.

952
01:21:10.324 --> 01:21:15.454
There's something in their heart
that stops them.

953
01:21:15.704 --> 01:21:16.955
I can feel it.

954
01:21:18.290 --> 01:21:19.875
They're cowards.

955
01:21:20.542 --> 01:21:24.129
- If so, that's terrible.
- It is terrible.

956
01:21:25.047 --> 01:21:28.509
Why were we born
in a world like this?

957
01:21:32.971 --> 01:21:35.557
- We'll pay the bill now.
- Okay.

958
01:21:37.976 --> 01:21:41.480
I'm worried about
the walk back.

959
01:21:41.855 --> 01:21:42.773
Right,

960
01:21:43.357 --> 01:21:45.025
we have to go too.

961
01:21:54.535 --> 01:21:57.621
- I'll go to the restroom.
- Go ahead.

962
01:22:01.458 --> 01:22:03.961
- Goodbye.
- Thanks.

963
01:22:05.045 --> 01:22:06.672
Have a good night.

964
01:22:08.257 --> 01:22:09.091
Have a good night.

965
01:22:18.517 --> 01:22:21.437
Should we have a cigarette?

966
01:22:21.812 --> 01:22:22.771
Should we?

967
01:22:23.814 --> 01:22:26.024
Dad said he doesn't mind.

968
01:22:26.608 --> 01:22:27.818
Let's smoke.

969
01:22:38.036 --> 01:22:40.956
What'll you do now?
Are you going home?

970
01:22:41.623 --> 01:22:43.125
How could I go home?

971
01:22:43.834 --> 01:22:45.961
No designated driver
service here.

972
01:22:49.006 --> 01:22:50.048
Right.

973
01:22:51.425 --> 01:22:55.929
We'll get a room in the hotel,
and rest or sleep.

974
01:22:56.930 --> 01:22:59.391
What else can we do?
Let's go in the morning.

975
01:23:02.644 --> 01:23:05.814
Are you okay
driving to the hotel?

976
01:23:06.607 --> 01:23:08.192
It's just around the corner.

977
01:23:09.276 --> 01:23:10.569
It's only two minutes.

978
01:23:11.403 --> 01:23:12.571
It'll be fine.

979
01:23:39.765 --> 01:23:40.807
Dad.

980
01:24:00.786 --> 01:24:02.162
Where did he go?

981
01:24:02.204 --> 01:24:03.914
He sent a message.

982
01:24:06.708 --> 01:24:11.213
<i>I drank too much.
I'll just walk.</i>

983
01:24:12.047 --> 01:24:13.674
<i>See you at the hotel.</i>

984
01:24:14.132 --> 01:24:15.509
Oh my...

985
01:24:15.968 --> 01:24:17.636
He's going to walk to the hotel?

986
01:24:17.719 --> 01:24:20.180
He drank too much.

987
01:24:20.764 --> 01:24:22.140
What now?

988
01:24:22.266 --> 01:24:23.767
- What do we do?
- What?

989
01:24:23.809 --> 01:24:26.395
Do we follow him?
Of course.

990
01:24:26.436 --> 01:24:27.604
Right.

991
01:24:27.813 --> 01:24:30.691
He's drunk.
We let him drink too much.

992
01:24:30.732 --> 01:24:32.317
- Hurry, let's go!
- Okay.

993
01:25:37.049 --> 01:25:41.053
I wrote a poem.

994
01:25:41.511 --> 01:25:43.889
I'd like to read it
to you two.

995
01:25:45.557 --> 01:25:48.226
I wanted to give
this poem to you.

996
01:25:52.230 --> 01:25:57.110
I'm so happy to have met
you here by chance.

997
01:25:58.862 --> 01:26:01.948
I'll read this poem,
and go.

998
01:26:02.658 --> 01:26:03.659
Yes.

999
01:26:04.534 --> 01:26:05.827
Thank you.

1000
01:26:18.548 --> 01:26:20.509
The snow is falling.

1001
01:26:22.427 --> 01:26:25.180
There's an organization
called Ika,

1002
01:26:25.222 --> 01:26:29.601
and people are subjugated
by them for no reason.

1003
01:26:31.228 --> 01:26:33.563
Some people are not
under their control.

1004
01:26:34.940 --> 01:26:38.360
But those who are,
are controlled for no reason.

1005
01:26:39.695 --> 01:26:43.490
Ika doesn't allow
its people to move.

1006
01:26:43.865 --> 01:26:48.036
The right to move
is held exclusively by them.

1007
01:26:49.955 --> 01:26:55.335
If you become a member of Ika,
you cannot move as you wish.

1008
01:26:58.505 --> 01:27:00.424
On the day it snowed,

1009
01:27:01.174 --> 01:27:05.846
two women brought
a small boy.

1010
01:27:07.681 --> 01:27:12.686
He is a small child,
and he has a projecting tooth.

1011
01:27:13.520 --> 01:27:18.024
But he is beautiful nonetheless.

1012
01:27:19.609 --> 01:27:25.824
Gradually people realize that
he is a precious child.

1013
01:27:27.617 --> 01:27:32.664
The two mothers want to
take this child away.

1014
01:27:34.332 --> 01:27:39.045
But however much time passes,
they can't leave.

1015
01:27:39.588 --> 01:27:46.887
They want to go, but people
are too fascinated by the boy.

1016
01:27:48.847 --> 01:27:53.143
Ika wants to keep
the boy there.

1017
01:28:13.205 --> 01:28:17.959
This boy who makes
other people happy remains here.

1018
01:28:19.878 --> 01:28:22.798
Since the mothers can't take him,

1019
01:28:22.839 --> 01:28:27.469
he grows up there in darkness.

1020
01:28:32.891 --> 01:28:34.309
He grows taller,

1021
01:28:34.351 --> 01:28:38.021
and now is all grown up.

1022
01:28:39.397 --> 01:28:43.819
His face is dark
and his eyes bulge.

1023
01:28:44.945 --> 01:28:48.782
I'm not sure if he resembles
the child he once was.

1024
01:28:50.033 --> 01:28:53.537
He's changed so much,
it's sad.

1025
01:28:56.122 --> 01:28:58.250
Ika is cruel.

1026
01:28:59.918 --> 01:29:03.713
Having changed so,
the boy pumps gas.

1027
01:29:04.506 --> 01:29:08.593
Like a man digging for coal,
he pumps gas.

1028
01:29:09.636 --> 01:29:14.099
In such a bleak
and lonely place,

1029
01:29:14.182 --> 01:29:18.436
all alone,
he holds the gas hose.

1030
01:29:21.940 --> 01:29:23.775
The snow is falling.

1031
01:29:40.458 --> 01:29:43.003
Let me pour you
a glass of soju.

1032
01:29:45.046 --> 01:29:46.381
Thank you.

1033
01:29:48.258 --> 01:29:49.551
It was so nice.

1034
01:29:50.594 --> 01:29:51.219
Yes.

1035
01:29:57.726 --> 01:29:59.352
Another glass?

1036
01:30:00.145 --> 01:30:01.563
Yes, thank you.

1037
01:30:01.605 --> 01:30:03.940
Are you okay?

1038
01:30:07.569 --> 01:30:11.239
I don't mind dying,
I welcome it!

1039
01:30:12.365 --> 01:30:14.576
As long as
you two are here.

1040
01:30:18.163 --> 01:30:19.956
That's a beautiful thing to say.

1041
01:30:22.667 --> 01:30:25.295
What was that poem?

1042
01:30:27.255 --> 01:30:30.050
I wrote it in the hotel.

1043
01:30:34.346 --> 01:30:36.890
One more glass.

1044
01:30:37.432 --> 01:30:38.224
Yes.

1045
01:30:45.023 --> 01:30:46.691
This is wonderful.

1046
01:30:47.400 --> 01:30:48.693
Thank you.

1047
01:30:51.279 --> 01:30:54.658
You two are angels.

1048
01:30:56.576 --> 01:30:57.661
Thank you.

1049
01:30:57.911 --> 01:30:59.913
You are so beautiful.

1050
01:31:00.664 --> 01:31:01.623
Thank you.

1051
01:31:01.706 --> 01:31:04.000
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1052
01:31:37.409 --> 01:31:38.785
<i>I'm in the room.</i>

1053
01:31:39.536 --> 01:31:40.954
<i>So you were worried.</i>

1054
01:31:41.913 --> 01:31:43.957
<i>Don't worry, go on home.</i>

1055
01:31:45.250 --> 01:31:50.213
<i>I'll remember seeing you today,
and be happy.</i>

1056
01:31:51.506 --> 01:31:54.259
<i>My sons have grown up
so beautifully.</i>

1057
01:31:54.926 --> 01:31:56.261
<i>It's true.</i>

1058
01:31:59.055 --> 01:32:00.390
Byungsoo.

1059
01:32:00.807 --> 01:32:01.766
Byungsoo!

1060
01:32:03.268 --> 01:32:05.020
Dad's in his room.

1061
01:32:25.290 --> 01:32:28.960
Shouldn't we go up
and say goodbye?

1062
01:32:29.335 --> 01:32:31.880
Yes, we'd better.

1063
01:32:33.715 --> 01:32:35.008
Let's go.

1064
01:32:51.316 --> 01:32:52.442
Is it here?

1065
01:32:52.692 --> 01:32:53.401
Yeah.

1066
01:32:54.486 --> 01:32:55.445
It's open.

1067
01:33:00.658 --> 01:33:01.534
Dad.

1068
01:33:02.368 --> 01:33:03.203
Dad!

1069
01:33:04.579 --> 01:33:05.872
- Dad!
- Dad!

1070
01:33:06.498 --> 01:33:07.749
- Dad!
- Dad!

1071
01:33:07.791 --> 01:33:10.168
What happened?
Dad!

1072
01:33:10.502 --> 01:33:12.921
- Dad!
- Don't shake him like that!

1073
01:33:12.962 --> 01:33:15.173
Dad! Dad! Dad!

1074
01:33:15.340 --> 01:33:16.299
Wait.

1075
01:33:16.341 --> 01:33:18.635
You can't shake him like that!

1076
01:33:18.676 --> 01:33:21.179
- Dad!
- Wait!

1077
